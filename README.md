# **7-segment displays component to use with MATLAB App Designer**
Everybody needs 7-segment displays isn't it? :-) In this example you will find two possible implementations of a group of 7-segment displays to use with the App Designer. Enjoy!

## **Overview**

***Goal***: Create a custom 7-segment displays to be use in the MATLAB App Designer

***Technique 1***: Creation of a custom MATLAB class called "SevenSegmentDisplays"

***Technique 2***: Creation of a custom MATLAB App class called "SevenSegmentDisplaysApp"

***Data used***: PNG mask images (straight and tilted) have been created to graphically design a 7-segment display

***MATLAB Project***: 7SegmentDisplays.prj

***MATLAB App***: DigitalClock.mlapp

## **Steps**

**Step 1**: To setup the project in MATLAB, double click on "7SegmentDisplays.prj"

**Step 2**: In the "project shortcut" tab on top, click on "1) Test UI Class" or "2) Test App Designer" to see the result of the 7-segment displays implementation.
To open these files from the shortcut tab, just do a "right-click" on them and "Open File"

**Step 3**: To see the 7-segment displays integrated into a more complex App, click on "Digital Clock".
To open this file from the shortcut tab, just do a "right-click" on it and "Open File"

**Step 4**: In the "Files" view of the project, the folder "UIClass" contains the implementation of the 7-segment displays component.
The class is "SevenSegmentDisplays"

## **Summary**
The aim of this example is to show how to create a custom graphical component in MATLAB or in the App Designer, and how to use it in an App Designer application
